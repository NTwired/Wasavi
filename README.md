The World’s 2nd Greatest Privacy Policy – A 13 Feb, 2020 Update
Short version:
WE DO NOT STORE OR COLLECT ANY DATA OR MESSAGES YOU SEND TO YOUR CONTACTS AND CRM.
With Wasavi, what happens on your device stays on your device.
Whenever you want to send your data to your CRM like Salesforce or Google Sheets, your data only moves when you tell it to – over the secure connections of those services and your device. No middleman is between your communications. If at any time you wish to remove your data you created in Wasavi app, you can do so by uninstalling the app.

Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Rock’n null (in this Policy: “Company“, “we“, “us“, and “our“). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at wasavi@rocknnull.com.
This Policy (the “Policy”) explains our privacy practices for our Services at www.rocknnull.com and any related domain names as well as through our “Wasavi” mobile application (collectively – the “Service” or the “Services”). It describes the ways your personal information and data is collected and used and the rights and options available to you with respect to your information.
This Policy is incorporated to the Service’s Terms of Use (the “Terms”) and constitutes an integral part of them.
 
You are not legally obligated to provide us Personal Data and may do so at your own free will. If you do not agree to provide us with such data or have it processed by us or any of our service providers, please contact us or not enter our Sites or use our Services.
Please read this privacy policy carefully as it will help you make informed decisions about sharing your personal information with us.
 
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Personal information – information that you provide us when you register to the Service or when you communicate with us or other users of the Service, including any personal information that becomes available to us when you register to the Service through a social network account, such as your basic profile information and your email address.
We collect data related to your use of the Service, such as information about the frequency of your use of the Service and content that you viewed. We may collect communication and transmission data that your mobile device generates or stores to help us provide the Service. For example, we may collect and receive the operating system version you use once you register to the Service.
 
Purchase Information – We collect data necessary to validate your purchase if you make purchases, for example your Order-Id and purchase token. All payments with our Service are processed and managed by the Google Billing Service. Purchase data is stored by our payment processor and you should review its privacy policies and contact the payment processor directly to respond to your questions.
 
Use of the Service is not bound to the creation of an account and some of the data is not collected before an account is registered. When you register with the Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain contact information and personal details, such as your active e-mail address and to enter a password or provide other details or attributes that define you as a user (such as your profile picture). We may collect additional information, as required, when we exchange communications with you.
Registration may also be available through social networks accounts, such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn. When registering through your social network account, you are allowing us access to your basic profile information (such as your name, age, email address). We can only access the information that your social network operator makes available to us, according to your privacy settings on such social network.
By registering to the Service through your social network account, you agree to share information (including personally identifiable information) between us and the applicable social network, for the purposes provided under this Policy. Any social network’s use of information, made available by the Service, is governed by the applicable social network’s privacy policy and controlled by it, not by this Policy or us.
Please bear in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated, abusive or unlawful information may prevent you from registering and may impair our ability to provide you the full scope of the Service, or to contact you.
When you register with the Service, you may be required to provide a username and set a unique password that will identify you each time you enter the Service. We may require other or additional means or methods of identification, from time to time.
 
The following information is collected from you without receiving your definitive consent:
The last time you entered the app, Registration date, First seen date, App version, Actions performed.
This information is being collected only in order to give you the best possible service and support. You’ll be able to see more information on the reasons we collect and use this data in the following section “How we use your personal information”.

•         To operate, maintain and enhance the Service;
•         To execute purchase transactions, which involve or relate to third parties such as payment providers and clearance services.

DE-IDENTIFIED OR AGGREGATED INFORMATION
We may use de-identified, statistical or aggregated information, including information that we process according to this policy, to properly operate the Service, to develop and improve the quality and functionality of the Service, to enhance your experience, to create new services, including customized services, to change or cancel existing features and for other research, development and statistical purposes.

SECURING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We and third parties on our behalf implement security measures to secure the information we store and process.

Therefore, while we take reasonable measures to secure the information, we cannot guarantee that it will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or unauthorized access.
 
DATA RETENTION
We retain different types of personally identifiable information for different periods, depending on the purposes for processing the information and our legitimate business purposes. When we no longer need to process the information that identifies you, we may take measures to de-identify the information.
Generally, as long as you are a user of the Service, we do not delete information related to you, unless there are technical reasons that require us to retain only portions of the data, or if we are required by law to delete it. This was decided for restoring purposes in case of crashes.
Please note that we will retain and disclose information when we deem it necessary to satisfy orders issued by courts and government authorities. We will notify you about the disclosure, only if we are explicitly permitted to do so. In any case, we may keep any aggregated or anonymous information for statistical, development, marketing and other purposes, indefinitely.
